        "\nHi everyone,\n First of all, thanks for having the time to check out my app!\n I am Suhas. Just a regular computer science engineering student from Bangalore.\n So, this is my first app. I didn't have any background in Java nor XML when i developed this app.\n You could say I developed this app out of nowhere. But yeah, the Internet was very helpful(as always, sigh).\n To outline the details of this app: \n 1) Opens Facebook. \n2) Opens Instagram.\n 3) Opens WhatsApp!.\n So click the button and have fun!"
